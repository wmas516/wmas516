### Hi I'm Will Massam I'm studying Part 2 Software Engineering at UOA  

     - I've been programming since 2019 when I was introduced to QBasic in high school

     - My primary language is Python but I have experience in QBasic, C and MATLAB 

     - Hoping to get experience in Java this year with concepts such as OOP, DSA and more
